## Subsystems

The robot is organized in different subsystems
* Chassis
* Intake
* Shooter
* Climber

## Capabilities
The robot is capable of certain things that might stand out and that increases it's performance
* Adjustment of range and distance using a Limelight
* 3 Different shooting settings depending on the position of the robot (Can be chosen by driver)
* Release ball through shooter if it is from the opposite alliance
* Release ball through intake if it is from the opposite alliance
* Voluntary break to avoid being pushed (We recommend to avoid using this and/or improve it to avoid damage to your motors and voltage spikes) 
* Toggle motor reductions to improve/decrease speed

## Autonomous
The autonomous moves out of the tarmac and shoots two balls 

## External libraries
We encourage the use of team 6647's library for JSON-oriented object initialization. We have used certain features from the library to program the robot. If you are interesed in finding more about said library, it can be found [here](https://github.com/VOLTEC6647/lib6647)
